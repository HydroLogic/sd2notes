# Statistics Review


## Predictive Models

### Gradient Boosting

* Gradient boosting (Freund and Schapire, 1997, 1996) is one of the most successful machine learning algorithms for nonparametric regression and classification

* Boosting adapitvely combines a large number of relatively simple prediction models called base learners into an ensembled learner to achieve high prediction performance. 


### Tweedie GLM





## Random Notes

* partial dependence plots to visualize the main effects and interaction effects
* the predictive accuracy is almost always better with a smaller shrinkage factor at the cost of more computing time
